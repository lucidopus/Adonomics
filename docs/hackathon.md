The Content Velocity Engine
1 - Overview
The advertising industry wastes enormous resources manually tagging, reviewing, and organizing video content. Creative teams spend 70-90% of their time on administrative tasks instead of actual creative work. Your challenge is to build an AI-powered system that transforms how creative teams manage their video assets, turning hours of manual work into minutes of intelligent automation.
2 - Challenge Description
Design and build a creative asset management system that can automatically analyze, categorize, and extract actionable insights from video content. Think beyond basic tagging – create a system that understands narrative structure, emotional beats, visual aesthetics, and production elements that creative professionals actually care about.
Your solution should help creative teams answer questions like: "What's the emotional arc of this ad?" "Which scenes have the strongest brand moments?" "How does this content compare to our most successful campaigns?" The goal is to reduce creative production time while providing insights that inform creative strategy.
3 - Sample Video Content
Here is a curated list of 10-15 publicly available YouTube videos that participants can consider using. This selection spans the key verticals (automotive, fashion, food & beverage, technology) and includes ads known for their strong emotional and creative elements.
Automotive
This category includes ads known for creative storytelling, brand-building, and visual innovation.
Volkswagen: "The Force" A highly successful Super Bowl ad famous for its simple, charming narrative and emotional connection, showcasing how a story can be told with minimal dialogue.
Honda: "Paper" This ad uses two minutes of seamless, stop-motion paper animation to illustrate the company's history of innovation, an excellent example of rich visual storytelling.
Saturn: "Sheet Metal" An imaginative ad that visualizes traffic and driving scenarios using people instead of cars to emphasize the human-centric design philosophy of the brand.
Fashion
These ads are characterized by their strong visual aesthetics, high production value, and focus on brand identity.
Gucci: "Aria" A campaign with a seductive and mysterious atmosphere, rich with visual details and set to a specific musical track, perfect for analyzing mood and brand aesthetic.
Giorgio Armani: "Fall/Winter 2025 Advertising Campaign" A recent example from a major fashion house that can be used to analyze current trends in luxury brand advertising.
Dior: "Autumn-Winter 2025-2026" This campaign provides another contemporary example for analyzing visual motifs and brand messaging in high fashion.
Food & Beverage
This selection offers a mix of humor, fantasy, and emotional storytelling to promote consumer products.
Chipotle: "Back to the Start" An award-winning animated film that tells the story of a farmer's journey towards sustainable agriculture, set to a memorable soundtrack. It's a prime example of narrative and emotional brand-building.
Coca-Cola: "Happiness Factory" A fantastical journey inside a vending machine that brings the brand's slogan to life through vibrant, imaginative animation and without dialogue.
Pepsi: "Is Pepsi, OK?" Featuring Steve Carell, this ad uses humor and celebrity power to directly address and reframe a common consumer perception in a witty, memorable way.
M&M's: "Pretzels" An ad that uses simple, clear visuals and a matching voice-over to deliver a focused message about a new product feature, demonstrating effective and concise communication.
Technology
Tech ads often blend product demonstration with human stories and sleek visuals.
Apple: "Fuzzy Feelings" A stop-motion animated short film for the holidays that tells an emotional story about creativity and connection, showcasing a product's use in a real-world, heartfelt context.
Google: "Project Sunroof" This ad explains a complex data-driven service by framing it as a simple, powerful tool for homeowners, blending animation with a clear call to action.
Microsoft: "Xbox Adaptive Controller" Aired during the Super Bowl, this ad features real gamers with limited mobility and their families. It's a powerful example of emotional marketing that focuses on the human impact of a product.
Emotional & Narrative-Driven
These ads are celebrated for their ability to connect with viewers on an emotional level through powerful storytelling.
P&G: "Thank You, Mom" A classic campaign that ties the brand to the emotional journey of Olympic athletes and their mothers, transcending product features to tell a universal human story.
John Lewis: "The Bear & The Hare" A hallmark of holiday advertising, this ad uses beautiful animation and a cover song to tell a heartwarming story of friendship, creating a strong emotional arc.

The Context Guardian
1 - Overview
Brand safety isn't just about avoiding obvious red flags – it's about understanding cultural context, emotional tone, and subtle visual cues that could make or break a brand association. Current tools miss 40-60% of contextually inappropriate placements because they rely on keyword filtering instead of true comprehension. Build the brand safety system that finally understands what it's actually seeing.
2 - Challenge Description
Create an advanced brand safety platform that goes far beyond traditional blacklist approaches. Your system should understand visual context, cultural nuance, emotional sentiment, and brand alignment at a granular level. It should be able to distinguish between a news report about violence and an action movie scene, understand when political content might be sensitive for certain brands, and recognize cultural references that could be problematic in specific markets.
Think about edge cases: A cooking video that mentions "fire" shouldn't be flagged as unsafe, but footage of actual wildfires should be. A fitness video showing intense exercise is perfect for sports brands but might not suit luxury fashion. Your system needs to think like a human brand manager.
3 - Sample Videos
Contextual Nuance & False Positives
These videos contain keywords that would trigger a block from a basic system, but the actual context is safe or even positive. This directly tests a model's ability to avoid "false positives" and understand the true meaning behind the words .
Video: How to Cure Racism - Emmanuel Acho with Barack Obama
Why it's a challenge: This video's title and transcript contain the word "racism." A keyword-based system would flag and block this content. However, the context is a constructive dialogue about how to cure racism, featuring a former U.S. President. An advanced system should be able to identify the positive and educational intent, making it brand-safe .
Video: Kraft's "Send Nudes" Mac & Cheese Campaign Ad
Why it's a challenge: The campaign used the phrase "send nudes" as a pun on "noodles". A basic filter would immediately flag this for adult content. The challenge is twofold: first, to understand the intended pun, and second, to analyze the overwhelmingly negative public sentiment and backlash the campaign received, which made it brand-unsafe for different reasons.
Video: A cooking video showing a chef using an open flame (e.g., from a channel like Fire Kitchen) vs. a news report on California wildfires.
Why it's a challenge: Both videos feature "fire." The cooking video is perfectly suitable for a food or lifestyle brand. The wildfire news report is a tragedy and would be unsafe for nearly all brands. This tests the system's ability to distinguish between the creative use of an element and its presence in a crisis context, a specific edge case mentioned in the challenge document.
Cultural and Regional Sensitivity
This category tests the model's ability to recognize that what is acceptable in one culture may be unsuitable or unsafe in another.
Video: A generic travel vlog showing a beach scene with people in swimwear.
Why it's a challenge: In a Western market, this content is generally safe and suitable for a travel or fashion brand. However, in more conservative regions like the Middle East, the same content could be classified as unsafe . This tests the model's capacity for region-specific suitability profiles.
Video: A clip from a talk on cultural competence, like Dr. Raquel Martin's "You're Doing It Wrong".
Why it's a challenge: This video discusses a real-world example of a major cultural misstep: proposing to show Black youths a scene of police brutality as a "reasonable" stressor. The content is educational but deals with highly sensitive topics of race and trauma. A system must understand this is an expert discussion, not an endorsement of the act itself.
Video: A compilation of American idioms or Super Bowl commercials.
Why it's a challenge: Content packed with culture-specific references, humor, or events may be highly effective in its target market but confusing or irrelevant elsewhere. This challenges the system to identify content with high cultural specificity that may not be suitable for a global campaign.
Distinguishing Content Type and Intent
These videos require a system to differentiate between news reporting, entertainment, and opinion, even when the topic is the same.
Video: Just Kidding News discussion on the man who sued his ex-wife over "ugly babies".
Why it's a challenge: A formal news outlet might report this as a strange legal story. Just Kidding News presents it as a casual, humorous group discussion. The system must distinguish between a factual report and opinion-based entertainment to determine brand suitability.
Video: A documentary about a former adult film star's conversion to Christianity.
Why it's a challenge: A keyword filter might flag this for "adult film star." However, the content is a human-interest story about a life change. The model needs to classify the video based on its narrative and documentary style, not just keywords associated with a past profession.
Brand Suitability Edge Cases
These videos are not "unsafe," but their suitability is highly dependent on the brand's identity and target audience.
Video: A high-intensity CrossFit or "Insanity" workout video.
Why it's a challenge: This is perfect for a sports drink, athletic apparel, or fitness equipment brand. However, the intensity, sweat, and physical strain would be completely misaligned with the branding of a luxury fashion house or a high-end watchmaker. This tests the model's ability to match content mood and style to specific brand verticals.
Video: A "Top 10 Worst Marketing Fails" analysis video.
Why it's a challenge: The video is filled with negative terms ("worst," "fail," "cringe"), but the content itself is a valuable and educational analysis for a B2B audience of marketing professionals. A sophisticated system should identify the context as a professional case study, making it suitable for B2B tech or consulting firms.
4 - Evaluation Criteria
Contextual Accuracy (35%): How well does the system understand nuanced context vs. surface-level flags?
Cultural Sensitivity (25%): Can it recognize cultural and regional considerations for global brands?
Enterprise Scalability (25%): Does this work at the scale of millions of videos per day?
Brand Customization (15%): How easily can brands configure their specific safety parameters?
5 - Submission Requirements
Real-time content analysis demo with confidence scoring
Brand safety dashboard showing risk categories and explanations
Comparison with existing tools showing improvement in accuracy
Cultural sensitivity testing across 3 different market contexts
API documentation for integration with major ad serving platforms

The Moment Matcher
1 - Overview
The holy grail of advertising is perfect contextual alignment – showing the right ad at exactly the right moment in content. But today's contextual advertising is embarrassingly primitive, relying on webpage keywords instead of understanding what's actually happening in video content. With 80% of digital content being video, we're essentially flying blind. Time to change that.
2 - Challenge Description
Build an intelligent contextual advertising system that can identify perfect ad placement opportunities within video content. Your system should understand not just what's happening, but the emotional context, narrative flow, and audience engagement patterns that make certain moments ideal for specific types of advertising.
Consider the complexity: A travel ad might work during a beautiful landscape scene but not during a stressful airport security sequence in the same travel video. A food ad could be perfect when someone mentions being hungry but terrible during a diet conversation. Your system needs to understand these subtle contextual cues and match them with appropriate advertising categories.
3 - Sample Videos
3.1 - Vlogs with Strong Narrative and Emotional Arcs
Vlogs are perfect for this challenge because they blend everyday activities with personal storytelling, creating frequent and natural shifts in mood and topic.
Video: "The ups and downs of LIFE IN YOUR 30s an emotional rollercoaster" by Chelsea Callahan
Why it's a challenge: This 24-minute vlog is a goldmine of contextual moments. The vlogger discusses serious topics like her cat's newly diagnosed heart disease (moment of anxiety, unsuitable for most ads) , her decision to go back to school (moment of excitement and ambition, suitable for educational or productivity brands) , and her search for a Beyoncé concert outfit (moment of fun and fashion, ideal for a clothing or entertainment brand). The system must differentiate these moments and match them with appropriate ad categories.
Video: A long-form travel vlog (e.g., a "day in the life" video from a creator in a foreign city).
Why it's a challenge: A travel vlog contains many distinct "moments." A beautiful shot of a landmark is a great time for a travel booking site ad. A segment where the vlogger is struggling with a foreign language could be an opportunity for a language-learning app. A scene where they are enjoying a local meal is perfect for a food delivery service. The challenge is to identify these micro-moments within the broader "travel" theme.
Video: "an oversharing vlog... lots of emotional realizations" by a lifestyle vlogger
Why it's a challenge: These vlogs often feature raw, emotional discussions about personal growth and mental health. A moment of vulnerability and tears is highly unsuitable for a cheerful, upbeat ad. However, a moment of triumph or positive realization could be a perfect fit for an ad from a wellness or therapy app. The system needs to track the emotional flow of the conversation.
3.2 - Podcasts and Interviews
Audio-driven content like podcasts forces the system to rely on conversational cues—tone of voice, topic changes, and specific phrases—to find the right ad moments.
Video: The Joe Rogan Experience or similar long-form interview podcast (Lex Fridman Prodcast).
Why it's a challenge: A three-hour conversation can cover dozens of topics. A segment discussing fitness and nutrition is ideal for a supplement brand. A moment later, a discussion about space exploration could be a great fit for a tech company or a sci-fi movie. A system must be able to parse these topic shifts in real-time to serve relevant ads.
Video: Good Mythical Morning with Rhett & Link.
Why it's a challenge: Episodes often involve taste tests or trying new products. A moment where they express hunger or excitement before eating is a prime spot for a food ad. A moment of disgust after trying something strange is obviously not. The system must understand the positive vs. negative framing of the food experience.
Video: A business or marketing podcast like "Success with long form video content".
Why it's a challenge: This content is educational and targeted at professionals. Moments where the host discusses a specific problem (e.g., "why they're not actually seeing conversions") are perfect opportunities for a B2B SaaS company to advertise a solution. The system should identify these "problem" statements as ideal contextual triggers.
3.3 - Documentaries
Documentaries offer a clear narrative structure and are rich with thematic moments that can be aligned with brand messaging.
Video: Living on One Dollar
Why it's a challenge: This documentary follows four friends living in poverty in rural Guatemala. While the overall theme is serious, there are moments of hope, community, and innovation. An ad for a flashy consumer good would be tone-deaf. However, an ad for a non-profit, a socially conscious investment firm, or an educational platform could be highly effective if placed in a moment of positive resolution.
Video: The White Helmets
Why it's a challenge: This film depicts the harrowing work of rescue workers in Syria. It is an extreme example of brand-unsafe content for most advertisers. The challenge here is for the system to correctly identify the entire film as a "no-go" zone for advertising, demonstrating an understanding of "sacred" content that should not be monetized with pre-roll or mid-roll ads.
Video: Our Planet or a similar nature documentary.
Why it's a challenge: These films have stunning visuals. A sweeping shot of an untouched landscape is a perfect moment for an eco-friendly travel company or an outdoor gear brand. A segment discussing the threat of climate change, however, would require a different type of advertiser, such as a sustainability-focused brand or an environmental organization.
3.4 - Tutorials and How-To Videos
Tutorials have a clear, step-by-step narrative flow, creating predictable moments for relevant ad placements.
Video: A complex recipe video (e.g., "how to make croissants from scratch").
Why it's a challenge: The video will have distinct phases. A moment when the chef lists the ingredients is perfect for a grocery delivery service ad. A segment showing a specific piece of equipment (like a stand mixer) is an opportunity for a kitchenware brand. The system must recognize these different stages of the tutorial.
Video: A DIY home improvement video (e.g., "how to build a bookshelf").
Why it's a challenge: The creator will mention specific tools and materials at different points. A moment discussing the need for a power drill is a perfect trigger for an ad from a hardware company. A segment on staining the wood could trigger an ad for a paint or wood finish brand.
Video: A software tutorial (e.g., "getting started with Photoshop").
Why it's a challenge: The user is in a learning mindset. A moment where the instructor mentions the difficulty of a certain task is an ideal time to advertise a plugin or template that simplifies that exact task. This requires the system to understand not just the topic, but the user's potential pain points.
4 - Evaluation Criteria
Contextual Precision (40%): How accurately does the system identify optimal ad placement moments?
Engagement Prediction (25%): Can it predict which placements will drive higher engagement?
Brand-Content Alignment (20%): How well does it match brand personality with content mood?
Revenue Optimization (15%): Does this demonstrably improve monetization for publishers?
 5 - Submission Requirements

Engagement prediction model with confidence intervals
Brand-content matching algorithm with reasoning explanations
Revenue impact projection based on historical data
Publisher-friendly dashboard for ad inventory optimization

The Creative Intelligence Lab
1 - Overview
The best practice for Marketing teams planning for their next brand campaign is to pre-test their campaign creatives, to measure the persuasive power of their ads before launch. They collect and analyze quantitative data on upper funnel metrics such as brand favorability, purchase consideration, and brand associations. The gold standard methodology to do this pre-testing is to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) survey experiment. Swayable measures the impact of ads on these metrics by analyzing the quantitative responses collected in these experiments. 
Swayable also collects longform qualitative feedback (open-end responses) which Advertisers measure persuasion of their planned campaigns on Swayable, which helps them identify the most persuasive ads as well as refine them before launch, and avoid ads that might have low or negative impact. Qualitative feedback contains nuggets of information about what elements of the creative resonated with various audience segments, and what should be changed. The combination of information from quantitative measurements, qualitative feedback and video understanding can reveal specific creative recommendations to maximize persuasion.  
Website: www.swayable.com
2 - Challenge Description
Build a system that analyzes the quant and qual feedback from creative pretesting along with the details of  the video creative, to identify creative elements that resonate with various audiences, and generate specific recommendations for what to change / remove / add in the creative. 
The creative recommendations might vary for different audience segments and different brand objectives (e.g. brand favorability vs. purchase intent).
3 - Sample Video Content and Dataset 
Here are the results of four sample experiments, with a variety of creative approaches, and measuring a range of brand metrics
