# Adonomics: Creative Genome - Performance Insights Dashboard

An AI-powered tool that analyzes video ads to explain *why* they worked, not just *what* happened.

## The Problem

Marketers and creative teams often make subjective decisions about ad creative, leading to inefficient A/B testing and wasted ad spend. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact creative elements—a specific scene, an emotional tone, a piece of music—that drive campaign performance and brand lift.

## Our Solution

The Creative Genome project is an AI-powered dashboard that turns subjective creative decisions into data-backed guidance. It dissects video ads to map their "emotional DNA," providing actionable insights to optimize creative strategy.

The tool works by:
1.  Breaking down each video ad into its constituent scenes.
2.  Analyzing each scene for emotional arcs (e.g., joy, humor, tension), objects, and pacing using advanced Video and Sentiment AI.
3.  Cross-referencing this analysis with performance data (e.g., persuasion metrics, conversion rates, CTR).
4.  Surfacing insights that show which creative elements are driving results.

This allows marketers to move beyond blind A/B tests and understand the "so what" behind their ad performance.
