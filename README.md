## 🎯 The Problem

Marketers and creative teams often make subjective decisions about ad creative, leading to inefficient A/B testing and wasted ad spend. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact creative elements—a specific scene, an emotional tone, a piece of music—that drive campaign performance and brand lift.

## 🚀 Our Solution

The Creative Genome project is an AI-powered dashboard that turns subjective creative decisions into data-backed guidance. It dissects video ads to map their "emotional DNA," providing actionable insights to optimize creative strategy.

The tool works by:
1. Breaking down each video ad into its constituent scenes
2. Analyzing each scene for emotional arcs, objects, and pacing using advanced Video AI
3. Cross-referencing this analysis with performance data and user feedback
4. Surfacing insights that show which creative elements are driving results

This allows marketers to move beyond blind A/B tests and understand the "so what" behind their ad performance.
